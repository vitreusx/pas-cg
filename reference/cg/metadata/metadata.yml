name: Coarse-grained contact-based molecular dynamics model of structured and disordered proteins
description: A molecular dynamics implicit-solvent coarse-grained model where each pseudoatom represents one amino acid residue. Residues are harmonically connected to form a chain. The system evolves according to Langevin dynamics. The backbone stiffness potential involves bond angle and dihedral angle terms (or a chirality term in the structured case). Residues interact via modified Lennard-Jones or Debye-Hueckel potentials.
