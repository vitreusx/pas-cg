# Before we continue: the specs for the forces in the following stanzas adhere
# to a regular schema. We distinguish two types of specs: a regular spec, for
# stuff like a backbone-backbone force, and an "ss" spec for sidechain-sidechain
# forces which sometimes require per-residue-pair-type values of the parameters.

# An example spec for the regular forces.
a random force:
  # Force variant to be used. Options:
  # - "lj": Lennard-Jones force;
  # - "sink lj": a "sinking" LJ force, in which the pointlike minimum of the
  #   potential is extended to span a certain interval of the radii.
  # - "shifted lj": a version of the LJ force, effective only at close distances
  #   (i.e. below r_min) and shifted to make the value of the potential always
  #   positive.
  # - "harmonic": harmonic force.
  variant: lj

  # Parameters for the "lj" option.
